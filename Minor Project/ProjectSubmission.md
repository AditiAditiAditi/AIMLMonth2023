Summary(Optional) :   My project consists of 2 tasks- Exploratory data analysis, and a linear regression model that predicts the price of used cars, given its age. On analysis, we find that a linear regression model using car age is not accurate to predict the price of the car. We get very large MSE and RMSE values.
